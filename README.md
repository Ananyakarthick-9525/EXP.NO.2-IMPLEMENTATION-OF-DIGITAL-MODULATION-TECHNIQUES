    ii) Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
    iii) Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

## AIM    
 To Study and Realize ASK,FSK and PSK Modulation and Demodulation using the Digital Modulation Trainer Kit. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED
Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)   
## PROCEDURE
Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)
1. Connect the circuit/module for ASK modulation.
2. Apply a binary data signal (e.g., 1kHz square wave) from a function generator or pattern generator.
3. Apply a high-frequency carrier signal (e.g., 10kHz sine wave) as the carrier input.
4. Observe the modulated ASK output on the oscilloscope.
5. Verify that the carrier is present for binary '1' and absent or reduced for binary '0'.
6. Adjust the input frequency and note changes in the output waveform.

Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)
1. Set up the FSK modulation circuit/module.
2. Input a binary data signal (e.g., 1kHz square wave).
3. Use two different frequency carriers (e.g., 8kHz and 12kHz) controlled by the logic level of the binary input.
4. Observe the FSK output waveform on the oscilloscope.
5. Verify that binary '1' corresponds to one frequency and binary '0' to another.
6. Vary the data rate and observe the response.

Phase Shift Keying (PSK)
1. Connect the PSK modulator circuit/module.
2. Apply a binary input signal (e.g., 1kHz square wave).
3. Apply a carrier signal (e.g., 10kHz sine wave).
4. Observe the PSK output on the oscilloscope.
5. Verify that the phase of the carrier changes (typically by 180°) with each bit change in the binary input.
6. Adjust the input frequency and monitor the corresponding phase transitions in the output.

## RESULT 
ASK (Amplitude Shift Keying): The modulated signal was generated successfully. After demodulation, the output signal was obtained with a frequency of 450 Hz and an amplitude of 1.15 V.

FSK (Frequency Shift Keying): Two carrier signals of different frequencies were used. The modulated signal was obtained, and after demodulation, the output signal had a frequency of 2.0 Hz and an amplitude of 6.18 V.

PSK (Phase Shift Keying): The modulated signal was produced using carriers with a 180° phase shift. After demodulation, the signal was recovered with a frequency of 320 Hz and an amplitude of 1.09 V.
